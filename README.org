This program compiles with almost if not all c++ compilers.

You can run this project on linux by running following commands.  

Linux:  

mkdir build-dir    
cd    build-dir    
cmake ..    
make    

From here you can select to run the "HeightMapScene.exe" file that will have been built.  

Windows: 
Download the newest Cmake GUI **"https://cmake.org/download/"**

Find the folder of the source code and tell CMake where to build the binaries.
Press configure button and then click generate to make the binaries.
From there you can run the .exe which would be in the "build" folder.

Windows/visual studio:

With visual studio you open the folder through the GUI/Clone the project and press "CTRL+SHIFT+B" to build the project once it's loaded.
From there click on "main.cpp" and "set-up as starting item". From there you are ready to run the program.

Windows/CLion/g++:

CLion unlike visual studio has no solution. CLion deals in CMake projects. Therefore either clone using CLion GUI or at startup press
"new project from source" and select the cloned folder. When you open this folder CMake will automatically get generated and it's ready to run.  
Click and run the HeightMapScene.exe executable.

Windows/visual studio with vcpkg (windows package manager)

Go to the github repository for vcpkg and clone that/download zip. You can put in **anywhere.**  
**open powershell** in the same folder. Run command: `.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`, if you are using cmake, use the last line for the next part     
Run command: `.\vcpkg integrate install`    
Now you are able to run these following commands: `.\vcpkg install package_name:x64-windows`      
For this project you will need to install the following packages **glew,glfw3,assimp,glm,openAL**
